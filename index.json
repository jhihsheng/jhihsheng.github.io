The metal nanospheroid acts as a plasmonic nanoresonator that supports two rotating modes, which are coupled to the corresponding valleys of MoS2. We apply external circularly polarized light that selectively pumps only one of the valleys of MoS$_2$. The generated spaser dynamics strongly depends on the size (radius) of the MoS$_2$ nanoflake. For a small radius, the system has only one spasing regime when only the chirally matched plasmon mode is generated, while at a larger size of MoS$_2$, depending on the pump intensity, there are two regimes. In one regime, only the chirally matched plasmon mode is generated, while in the other regime both chirally matched and chirally mismatched modes exist. Different regimes of spaser operation also have opposite handedness of the far-field radiated spaser system. Such a topological nanospaser has potential applications in different areas of infrared spectroscopy, sensing, probing, and biomedical treatment.","tags":null,"title":"Topological Nanospaser","type":"publication"},{"authors":["吳致盛","吳恩達"],"categories":["Demo","教程"],"content":"Overview  The Wowchemy website builder for Hugo, along with its starter templates, is designed for professional creators, educators, and teams/organizations - although it can be used to create any kind of site The template can be modified and customised to suit your needs.

When one valley of the TMDC is selectively pumped (e.g. by a circular-polarized radiation), the spaser (surface plasmon amplification by stimulated emission of radiation) generates a mode carrying a topological chiral charge that matches that of the gain valley. There is another, chirally mismatched, time-reversed mode with exactly the same frequency but the opposite topological charge; it is actively suppressed by the gain saturation and never generates, leading to a strong topological protection for the generating matched mode. This topological spaser is promising for use in nano-optics and nanospectroscopy in the near field especially in applications to biomolecules that are typically chiral. Another potential application is a chiral nanolabel for biomedical applications emitting in the far field an intense circularly polarized coherent radiation.","tags":null,"title":"Topological Nanospaser","type":"publication"},{"authors":["吳致盛"],"categories":null,"content":"","date":1577836800,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"zh-hant","lastmod":1577836800,"objectID":"dab3f261872d0eeed07021df0282add2","permalink":"https://jhihsheng.github.io/publication/2020_prl_ts/","publishdate":"2020-01-01T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/publication/2020_prl_ts/","section":"publication","summary":"We theoretically introduce a topological spaser, which consists of a hexagonal array of plasmonic metal nanoshells containing an achiral gain medium in their cores.  Such a spaser can generate two mutually time-reversed chiral surface plasmon modes in the valleys $K$ and $K'$, which carry the opposite topological charges $\\pm 1$, and are described by a two-dimensional $E'$ representation of the $D_{3h}$ point symmetry group.
