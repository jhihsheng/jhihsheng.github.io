The metal nanospheroid acts as a plasmonic nanoresonator that supports two rotating modes, which are coupled to the corresponding valleys of MoS2. We apply external circularly polarized light that selectively pumps only one of the valleys of MoS$_2$. The generated spaser dynamics strongly depends on the size (radius) of the MoS$_2$ nanoflake. For a small radius, the system has only one spasing regime when only the chirally matched plasmon mode is generated, while at a larger size of MoS$_2$, depending on the pump intensity, there are two regimes. In one regime, only the chirally matched plasmon mode is generated, while in the other regime both chirally matched and chirally mismatched modes exist. Different regimes of spaser operation also have opposite handedness of the far-field radiated spaser system. Such a topological nanospaser has potential applications in different areas of infrared spectroscopy, sensing, probing, and biomedical treatment.","tags":["highlight"],"title":"TMDC-Based Topological Nanospaser: Single and Double Threshold Behavior","type":"publication"},{"authors":["吳致盛","吳恩達"],"categories":["Demo","教程"],"content":"Overview  The Wowchemy website builder for Hugo, along with its starter templates, is designed for professional creators, educators, and teams/organizations - although it can be used to create any kind of site The template can be modified and customised to suit your needs.

For a circularly polarized pulse, such dynamics is governed by topological resonance, which manifests itself as a specific conduction band population distribution in the vicinity of the Weyl points. The topological resonance is determined by the competition between the topological phase and the dynamic phase and depends on the handedness of a circularly polarized pulse.

The mechanism of RET above a gold surface can be attributed to the effects of mirror dipoles, surface plasmon polaritons (SPPs), and retardation. To clarify these effects on RET, we analyze the enhancements of RET by the mirror method, the decomposition of s- and p-polarization, and the SPP dispersion of charge-symmetric and charge-antisymmetric modes. We find a characteristic distance (approximately 1/10 of the wavelength) that can be used to classify the dominant effect on RET. Moreover, the characteristic distance can be shortened by narrowing the thickness of the thin-film systems, indicating that SPPs can enhance the rate of RET at a short range. The charge-symmetric and charge-antisymmetric modes of the thin films also allow us to engineer the maximum RET enhancement. We hope that our analysis inspires further investigation into the mechanism of RET coupled with SPPs and its applications.","tags":["highlight"],"title":"Characteristic distance of resonance energy transfer coupled with surface plasmon polaritons","type":"publication"},{"authors":["S.

Our modeling shows that near-field spectroscopy can measure the magnitude of the superconducting energy gap in Bardeen-Cooper-Schrieffer-like superconductors with nanoscale spatial resolution. We demonstrate how the same technique can measure the $c$-axis plasma frequency, and thus the $c$-axis superfluid density, of layered unconventional superconductors with a similar spatial resolution. Our modeling also shows that near-field techniques can image superfluid surface mode interference patterns near physical and electronic boundaries. We describe how these images can be used to extract the collective mode dispersion of anisotropic superconductors with subdiffractional spatial resolution.","tags":null,"title":"Infrared nanospectroscopy and imaging of collective superfluid excitations in anisotropic superconductors","type":"publication"},{"authors":null,"categories":null,"content":"","date":-62135596800,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"zh-hant","lastmod":-62135596800,"objectID":"f26b5133c34eec1aa0a09390a36c2ade","permalink":"https://jhihsheng.github.io/admin/config.yml","publishdate":"0001-01-01T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/admin/config.yml","section":"","summary":"","tags":null,"title":"","type":"wowchemycms"}]
